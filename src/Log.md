Figured out how to load up a 3d model from blender in to github via visual code studios. 
by pushing directing from the vsc terminal
then signing on to vercel and connecting to github directly. connecting to a domain, poripong. 
this took me 2 days. about 30 hours of studying.

today, i will figure out how to use UV mapping and animation on blender, eventually bringing that over in to vercel somehow. and making it interactive.
